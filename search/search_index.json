It's incredibly easy, took almost no time at all. Kudos to the developers for their work and thorough instruction manual. Second, I'm out of touch with a few different subjects, so I'm choosing to write about them as a way to refresh my memory. Periodically, I'll add more to this archive as I re-study my notes on the topic. If you are looking for a comprehensive high-level summary of different technologies, you are not yet in the right place. Disclaimer I do not profess to be an expert, power user, or any other type of aficionado on the subject of Artificial Neural Networks or any other technology. I've taken a few classes to gain an understanding of their purposes and used a Neural Network for a project at my job.

That's kind of true, but there is definitely more to them than that. Artificial Neural Networks are a machine learning method that can help solve a variety of issues such as classification, computer vision and object recognition, forecasting, self-driving cars, and more. How do Neural Networks work? A neural network multiplies the input variables depicted by a m x n matrix by a randomly initialized matrix of weights, added to a bias vector of m x 1 dimensions. Then, the product is compared to a y output vector of size 1 x n and then the difference is subtracted from the weights matrix. This process is repeated continuously to help it converge, or where the derivative at the cost function is 0, meaning the model is at its peak performance based on the training data provided.
