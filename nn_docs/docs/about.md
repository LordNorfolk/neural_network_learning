# About

The reason I chose to do this little project is twofold: First, I wanted to learn how to use MKDocs. It's incredibly easy, took almost no time at all. Kudos to the developers for their work and thorough instruction manual. 

Second, I'm out of touch with a few different subjects, so I'm choosing to write about them as a way to refresh my memory. Periodically, I'll add more to this archive as I re-study my notes on the topic. If you are looking for a comprehensive high-level summary of different technologies, you are not yet in the right place. 

## Disclaimer

I do not profess to be an expert, power user, or any other type of aficionado on the subject of Artificial Neural Networks or any other technology. I've taken a few classes to gain an understanding of their purposes and used a Neural Network for a project at my job.
