# Neural Networks

I once heard a description of a Neural Network as "A bunch of ninth-grade math that's strung together in a more complex way". That's kind of true, but there is definitely more to them than that. Artificial Neural Networks are a machine learning method that can help solve a variety of issues such as classification, computer vision and object recognition, forecasting, self-driving cars, and more. 


## How do Neural Networks work?

A neural network multiplies the input variables depicted by a *m x n* matrix by a randomly initialized matrix of weights, added to a bias vector of *m x 1* dimensions. Then, the product is compared to a y output vector of size *1 x n* and then the difference is subtracted from the weights matrix. This process is repeated continuously to help it converge, or where the derivative at the cost function is 0, meaning the model is at its peak performance based on the training data provided.
